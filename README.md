This Mod makes it so default Minecraft capes (like account migration one) appear **BIG** like when wearing an Elytra.
Looks better in my opinion.
 
It's my first ever Minecraft Mod made for Fabric.

## Forge Port
Might port it to Forge someday. It's really not **that** hard to do it yourself.

## Building from source
*Why would anyone ever do that tho*

Just run `./gradlew build` in terminal and go to `build/libs` folder for output.
